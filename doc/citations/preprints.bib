% "The Newton method was used to linearise the system of non-linear equations for the solid sub-problem and the
% linear system of equations was solved using a generalised minimal residual iterative method (GMRES) with
% an additive Schwarz preconditioner..."
% It is not explicitly stated that the implementation is based on MOOSE, although MOOSE is cited. Need to ask the authors for more information.
